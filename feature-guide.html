                    <h2>Tracking and Adjusting Exercises</h2>
                    
                    <p>The <strong>Exercise Dialog</strong> makes it easy to track and adjust any type of exercise. You can log weighted, bodyweight, cardio, and even custom progressions by choosing from different <strong>Exercise Types</strong> and <strong>Action Types</strong>.</p>
                    
                    <nav>
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="#exercise-types">Exercise Types</a></li>
                            <li><a href="#action-types">Action Types</a></li>
                            <li><a href="#difficulty">Difficulty</a></li>
                            <li><a href="#individual-set-tracking">Individual Set Tracking</a></li>
                            <li><a href="#adjustments">Adjustments</a></li>
                        </ul>
                    </nav>
                    
                    <p>For simplicity, the default mode assumes all sets use the same weight and reps. If you prefer more detail, you can enable <strong>Individual Set Tracking</strong> to record each set separately.</p>
                    
                    <p>To keep your training progressive, you can also set up <strong>personalized adjustments</strong> - either automatic or manual - to update your exercises for the next workout.</p>

                    <h3 id="exercise-types">Exercise Types</h3>
                    <p>Each exercise allows for different exercise types including weighted, bodyweight, and timed exercises. Exercise Types can be accessed by tapping the "Weight" button or your default exercise type found in the tracking tab in the exercise dialog. You can set your default exercise type in settings.</p>

                    <h3 id="action-types">Action Types</h3>
                    <p>The exercise <strong>Action Types</strong> can be accessed by tapping the "Reps" dropdown. The following Action Types are supported:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Reps</strong> – Count how many repetitions you perform (e.g., 12 squats).</li>
                        <li><strong>Time</strong> – Track the duration with a timer (e.g., 30-second plank).</li>
                        <li><strong>Text</strong> – Add a note or custom instruction (e.g., "Hold stretch until comfortable").</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <img src="https://uadvycszfglceffforyf.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/public_images/featured_content/feature_guide/tracking_and_adjusting_exercises/action_types.png" alt="Action Types" class="feature-image">

                    <h3 id="difficulty">Difficulty</h3>
                    <p><strong>Difficulty</strong> is a quick way to record how challenging an exercise felt — whether it was <strong>too hard</strong>, <strong>okay</strong>, or <strong>too easy</strong>. These ratings can also be used to make automatic adjustments to your workouts.</p>
                    
                    <p>We recommend using Difficulty as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Too Hard:</strong> You couldn't complete the last set.</li>
                        <li><strong>Okay:</strong> You reached failure or had about 1 rep left in the tank.</li>
                        <li><strong>Too Easy:</strong> You had 2-3 (or more) reps left in the tank.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <img src="https://uadvycszfglceffforyf.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/public_images/featured_content/feature_guide/tracking_and_adjusting_exercises/difficulty.png" alt="Difficulty Settings" class="feature-image">

                    <h3 id="individual-set-tracking">Individual Set Tracking</h3>
                    <p>Individual Set Tracking lets you log each set separately instead of assuming all sets use the same weight and reps in standard mode. For timed exercises, it also allows you to record different durations for each set.</p>
                    
                    <img src="https://uadvycszfglceffforyf.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/public_images/featured_content/feature_guide/tracking_and_adjusting_exercises/individual_set_tracking.png" alt="Individual Set Tracking" class="feature-image">

                    <h3 id="adjustments">Adjustments</h3>
                    <p>Exercise Adjustments keep your workouts progressing through <strong>progressive overload</strong>. After you record your <strong>Difficulty</strong>, automatic or custom adjustments appear on the end screen. You can choose between two modes: <strong>Automatic</strong> or <strong>Custom</strong>.</p>

                    <h4>Automatic Adjustments</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reps are increased or decreased within your set rep range first.</li>
                        <li>Weight only changes once you've reached the minimum or maximum reps.</li>
                        <li>Adjustments are applied to your next session after completing the current one.</li>
                        <li>Average Values can be enabled to base adjustments on the average weight and reps across all recorded sets for exercises with Individual Set Tracking enabled.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Your <strong>1 Rep Max (1RM)</strong> is an estimate of the maximum weight you could lift for a single repetition. This allows you to track your overall strength progress without testing a true max lift directly.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Daily</strong> – Schedules are given a start day and date. This mode loops scheduling routines after the last numerical day. This mode is best for programs that repeat for more than 7 days.</li>
                        <li><strong>Weekly</strong> – Schedules workouts by day of the week.</li>

                    <p>You can also manage backups manually:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Backup Options</strong> – Use the <strong>Backup</strong> and <strong>Restore</strong> buttons to save or retrieve your data.</li>
                        <li><strong>Local File Options</strong> – Save and restore a backup file directly to your device's storage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Local Backups</strong> – View all backup files stored within the app's documents folder.</li>
